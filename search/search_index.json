Before setting up and using GitHub within Visual Studio Code (VS Code), it is important to become familiar with fundamental concepts.</p>"},{"location":"git.html#terminologies","title":"Terminologies","text":"<p>Below are key terms that will help you grasp the basics of Git and GitHub:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Repository (Repo): A storage space where your project's files and their revision history are kept. Think of it as a project's folder.</p> </li> <li> <p>Initializing a Repository: The process of creating a new Git repository in a project directory.</p> </li> <li> <p>Commit: A snapshot of your project's files at a specific point in time. Each commit records changes made to the files, along with a message describing the changes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Staging: The process of selecting files that should be included in the next commit.</p> </li> <li> <p>Branch: A parallel version of your repository. Branches allow you to work on different features or fixes separately before merging them into the main project.</p> </li> <li> <p>Merging: The process of integrating changes from one branch into another. This is commonly done to combine a feature branch into the main branch after development.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pushing: The action of sending committed changes from your local repository to a remote repository.</p> </li> <li> <p>Clone: Creating a local copy of a remote repository on your machine, allowing you to work on the project offline.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fork: A personal copy of someone else's repository. Forking allows you to experiment with changes without affecting the original project.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pull Request (PR): A method of submitting contributions to a project. After making changes in a forked repository, you can open a PR to propose merging your changes into the original repository.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remote: A version of your repository hosted on the internet or another network. It can be accessed by multiple collaborators.</p> </li> <li> <p>Staging Area (Index): A space where changes are gathered before committing them. It allows you to prepare and review changes before finalizing them.</p> </li> <li> <p>Working Directory: The files and directories that you are currently working on. Changes here can be staged and then committed to the repository.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For a more comprehensive glossary, you can refer to the GitHub Glossary.</p>"},{"location":"git.html#setting-up-and-using-git","title":"Setting up and Using Git","text":"<p>The video below provides a comprehensive guide on setting up and using GitHub within Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
