# How to Create Markdown Files

This documentation provides a basic tutorial on creating and formatting Markdown (`.md`) files. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax that can be converted to HTML. It's widely used for README files, documentation, and more.

## Getting Started

To create a Markdown file, you just need a text editor. Save the file with the extension `.md` or `.markdown`.

Example:

```md
# My Project Documentation

Welcome to my project! This file is written in Markdown.
```

## Headers

Headers are created by adding one or more `#` symbols before your header text. The number of `#` symbols corresponds to the header level.

Example:

```markdown
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6
```

## Paragraphs and Line Breaks

Paragraphs are just one or more lines of consecutive text followed by one or more blank lines.

To create a line break, end a line with two or more spaces, then hit Return.

Example:

```markdown
This is a paragraph. It has two sentences.

This is another paragraph.  
This line is separated by a line break.
```

## Emphasis

You can italicize text by wrapping words in a single asterisk (`*`) or underscore (`_`). Bold text requires double asterisks (`**`) or underscores (`__`).

Example:

```markdown
*This text is italicized*, and so is _this text_.

**This text is bold**, and so is __this text__.
```

## Lists

You can create ordered and unordered lists.

Example:

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2

1. First item
2. Second item
```

## Links

To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (`[]`) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (`()`).

Example:

```markdown
This is [an example](http://example.com) link.
```

## Images

Images are similar to links, but they include a leading exclamation point (`!`), followed by the alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image in parentheses.

Example:

```markdown
![This is an image](http://example.com/image.jpg)
```

## Code

For inline code, wrap the text in backticks (`` ` ``). For code blocks, use three backticks or indent with four spaces.

Example:

```markdown
This is an inline `code` example.

```
This is a code block example.


## Tables

Tables are created using a combination of pipes (`|`) and dashes (`-`). The header row is separated from the body by a line of dashes.

Example:

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     |
| Row 2    | Data     |
```

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are created by prefixing lines with the `>` character.

Example:

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
```

## Horizontal Rules

Horizontal rules are created by placing three or more hyphens (`---`), asterisks (`***`), or underscores (`___`) on a line by themselves.

Example:

```markdown
---
```
